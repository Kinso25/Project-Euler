In this problem you have to figre out how many routes there are through a grid using only right and down movements while starting at the top left.

The grid is 20 x 20 (kind of, you can only travel through edges) and tbh its pretty overwhelming


INITIAL THOUGHTS:
gonna try with a smaller sample size
see if there is patterns
